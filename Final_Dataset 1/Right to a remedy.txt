Despite all of the above, the reality for millions of people is that governments often fail to uphold some or all of these rights. This is where the right to a remedy comes in. When we talk about having the right to a remedy, it means that everyone must be able to seek legal recourse when their rights have been violated.

The remedy must be accessible, binding, effective, and capable of delivering justice. It should both provide appropriate reparations for victims and prevent further violations of rights.

Although the right to a remedy ensures the ability to seek remedy from the state directly, international cooperation and assistance is vital in upholding this right. States should work together to ensure people can seek justice, as part of their extraterritorial obligations. This means that human rights obligations do not just stop at statesâ€™ borders when their actions impact those living in other countries.

The right to a remedy applies to all rights, for example when somebody has suffered torture or in the case of ESCR been forcibly evicted from their home. it can also apply when a business has abused their rights such as happened in Qatar.
