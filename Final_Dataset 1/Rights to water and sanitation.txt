The right to water is vital for every living thing â€“ without it we would die. We need water to drink and clean ourselves with, and for cooking and sanitation, which is also a right. Water is essential in the enjoyment of all other human rights including the right to life. It is also key in food production.

The right to sanitation enables people to access a clean and healthy environment, without it there are barriers to other rights, such as health and education.

Water must be available and accessible to all people in sufficient quantity and of adequate quality for all of the reasons it is needed. However, there are many ways in which the rights to water and sanitation are violated.

Pollution can make water unsafe. Water scarcity can lead to devastating drought. The climate crisis can often make this worse, exacerbating the lack of accessible, clean water. Governments and companies might control water supplies in ways which ensure people do not have adequate access to it. Human rights defenders have even been threatened with death for speaking out for this right.
