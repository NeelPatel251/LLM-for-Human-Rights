We all have the right to work, which includes both the rights to work and a set of rights at work (which are sometimes also called “labour rights”). All workers are protected by these rights whether you work in the formal or informal sector, are a migrant worker, a temporary worker or are self-employed.

Although the right to work is not the right to a job, it is a right to opportunities and conditions that can secure you decent work, enabling an adequate standard of living for you and your family.

Governments should provide support services to help people access work opportunities, and they must also develop ways to increase the number and range of opportunities available. Work opportunities must be available to all people without discrimination. Workers must also be able to form and join unions and engage in collective action.

No one should be forced in any way to work.

However, there is widespread violation of workers’ rights. Millions of people are forced to work against their will, or work in degrading and unfair conditions, such as in some Amazon warehouses. Others, due to lack of opportunity, have little choice but to take jobs in the “gig economy”, often meaning long hours, precarious contracts and unreliable pay.

Migrant workers are often among the worst exploited, and people can be manipulated into doing difficult and dangerous jobs with no protections from unscrupulous employers. This can lead to scenarios of what we call forced labour, which is a form of modern slavery.
