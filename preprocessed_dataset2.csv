Murder,"Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or- Secondly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or- Thirdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or- Fourthly.-If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. Illustrations (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos:- First.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Thirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills. Y, Z""s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to, A, A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as witness before Z, a Magistrate, Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z's nose, Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration A, by instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z""s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.",murder,except case hereinafter excepted culpable homicide murder act death caused done intention causing death secondlyif done intention causing bodily injury offender know likely cause death person harm caused thirdlyif done intention causing bodily injury person bodily injury intended inflicted sufficient ordinary course nature cause death fourthlyif person committing act know imminently dangerous must probability cause death bodily injury likely cause death commits act without excuse incurring risk causing death injury aforesaid illustration shoot z intention killing z dy consequence commits murder b knowing z labouring disease blow likely cause death strike intention causing bodily injury z dy consequence blow guilty murder although blow might sufficient ordinary course nature cause death person sound state health knowing z labouring disease give blow would ordinary course nature kill person sound state health although may intend cause bodily injury guilty murder intend cause death bodily injury ordinary course nature would cause death c intentionally give z swordcut clubwound sufficient cause death man ordinary course nature z dy consequence guilty murder although may intended cause z death without excuse fire loaded cannon crowd person kill one guilty murder although may premeditated design kill particular individual exception 1when culpable homicide murderculpable homicide murder offender whilst deprived power selfcontrol grave sudden provocation cause death person gave provocation cause death person mistake accident exception subject following proviso firstthat provocation sought voluntarily provoked offender excuse killing harm person secondlythat provocation given anything done obedience law public servant lawful exercise power public servant thirdlythat provocation given anything done lawful exercise right private defence explanationwhether provocation grave sudden enough prevent offence amounting murder question fact illustration influence passion excited provocation given z intentionally kill z child murder much provocation given child death child caused accident misfortune act caused provocation b give grave sudden provocation provocation fire pistol neither intending knowing likely kill z near sight kill z committed murder merely culpable homicide c lawfully arrested z bailiff excited sudden violent passion arrest kill z murder much provocation given thing done public servant exercise power appears witness z magistrate z say believe word deposition perjured moved sudden passion word kill z murder e attempt pull z nose z exercise right private defence lay hold prevent moved sudden violent passion consequence kill z murder much provocation given thing done exercise right private defence f z strike b b provocation excited violent rage bystander intending take advantage b rage cause kill z put knife b hand purpose b kill z knife b may committed culpable homicide guilty murder exception 2culpable homicide murder offender exercise good faith right private defence person property exceeds power given law cause death person exercising right defence without premeditation without intention harm necessary purpose defence illustration z attempt horsewhip manner cause grievous hurt draw pistol z persists assault believing good faith mean prevent horsewhipped shoot z dead committed murder culpable homicide exception 3culpable homicide murder offender public servant aiding public servant acting advancement public justice exceeds power given law cause death act good faith belief lawful necessary due discharge duty public servant without illwill towards person whose death caused exception 4culpable homicide murder committed without premeditation sudden fight heat passion upon sudden quarrel without offender taken undue advantage acted cruel unusual manner explanationit immaterial case party offer provocation commits first assault exception 5culpable homicide murder person whose death caused age eighteen year suffers death take risk death consent illustration instigation voluntarily cause z person eighteen year age commit suicide account z youth incapable giving consent death therefore abetted murder
