All of us have the right to adequate housing: a safe and secure place to call our home. You should be legally allowed to live there, and your housing should have access to basic services and infrastructure, such as water and sanitation. It must be affordable, and it must be adequate to protect you and your family from bad weather, disease and pollution.

Nobody should be homeless. According to international human rights law and standards, homelessness is an extreme violation of the right to adequate housing (among other rights).

Unfortunately, there are many other ways in which this right is violated, such as people being displaced in conflicts, and via practices such as forced evictions, like those of indigenous people like the Maasai, and by corporations, such as mining companies in the DRC.
