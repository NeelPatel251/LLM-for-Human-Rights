The right to food is more than just the right to eat enough to not die of starvation. Food should be available in sufficient quantities and be of high enough quality to satisfy everyone eating it, both in terms of health and dietary needs and within a given culture. It should also be affordable and accessible in a way that is sustainable.

In reality however, although there is enough food grown, produced and manufactured around the world for no one to go hungry or suffer from malnutrition, millions of people cannot access adequate and nutritious food on a daily basis due to government failings and multiple crises such as conflict and climate.

There are many ways in which the right to food can be affected by inadequate actions by governments. Food insecurity might be caused by huge rises in prices, or crisis situations might cause humanitarian aid (such as food and water supplies) might be blocked, for example in Ethiopia.
