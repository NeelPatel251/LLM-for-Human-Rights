We all have the right to education. Education is vital for human fulfilment and personal development, and it also enables us to access and better enjoy other rights, such as work, adequate housing, and a decent standard of living.

The right to education includes lifelong education at all levels (primary, secondary and tertiary), in either formal or informal settings. Primary level education is compulsory and must be provided for free to everyone. At higher levels governments must work towards making it free as well whilst still ensuring it is available and affordable to all.

Governments must prioritize and budget for free, affordable and quality public education, using and maximizing their resources to fund public schools, which are physically accessible and of adequate quality.

When this doesnâ€™t happen, it can cause great inequality, such as what Amnesty International found when it investigated in South Africa.
