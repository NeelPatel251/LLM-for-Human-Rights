Everyone has a right to social security. The right to social security is your right to access benefits to help you enjoy an adequate standard of living even when you do not have enough money and are unable to provide for your own basic needs. There are many situations in which you or others might not have enough income to get by without some extra support, including: unemployment, sickness, disability, maternity/paternity, injury, bereavement, and older age.

It is specifically aimed at reducing poverty, and ensuring that everyone can access their right to lead a dignified life, food, health, housing, education, work, and the prevention of social exclusion.

Even in lower-income countries where resources are limited, governments must at very least ensure the existence and operation of a social security system that provides essential support for all who need it. However, there are many places across the globe where governments are failing to provide this for their people.
