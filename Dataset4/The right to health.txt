The right to health is closely interwoven with all other human rights. We all have the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This includes what we call the “social determinants of health”, such as a healthy environment, freedom from violence and discrimination, food, housing, sanitation, water, and education and social security.

The right to health is not a right to be healthy, but to entitle everyone access to a health system that allows you to maintain and secure your health. Different groups of people – women, children, older persons, and people living with disabilities – might have specific needs, and governments should ensure these are understood and adequately addressed.

Despite this there are still many instances of health inequity, where some people are not able to access healthcare as easily as others. During the Covid-19 pandemic for example, there was widespread vaccine inequality, when the pharmaceutical industry restricted access to lifesaving vaccines from lower-income countries. Health inequity can also be caused by things like medication shortages, when governments have failed to adequately prepare for healthcare needs by not ensuring supplies are available, or by expensive fees which make accessing care and medicines unaffordable.

Governments can also fail to uphold the right to health by mismanaging public health crises, such as was also seen during the pandemic.
