"Despite all of the above, the reality for millions of people is that governments often fail to uphold some or all of these rights. This is where the right to a remedy comes in. When we talk about having the right to a remedy, it means that everyone must be able to seek legal recourse when their rights have been violated.

The remedy must be accessible, binding, effective, and capable of delivering justice. It should both provide appropriate reparations for victims and prevent further violations of rights.

Although the right to a remedy ensures the ability to seek remedy from the state directly, international cooperation and assistance is vital in upholding this right. States should work together to ensure people can seek justice, as part of their extraterritorial obligations. This means that human rights obligations do not just stop at states’ borders when their actions impact those living in other countries.

The right to a remedy applies to all rights, for example when somebody has suffered torture or in the case of ESCR been forcibly evicted from their home. it can also apply when a business has abused their rights such as happened in Qatar.",despite reality million people government often fail uphold right right remedy come talk right remedy mean everyone must able seek legal recourse right violated remedy must accessible binding effective capable delivering justice provide appropriate reparation victim prevent violation right although right remedy ensures ability seek remedy state directly international cooperation assistance vital upholding right state work together ensure people seek justice part extraterritorial obligation mean human right obligation stop state border action impact living country right remedy applies right example somebody suffered torture case escr forcibly evicted home also apply business abused right happened qatar
"The right to water is vital for every living thing – without it we would die. We need water to drink and clean ourselves with, and for cooking and sanitation, which is also a right. Water is essential in the enjoyment of all other human rights including the right to life. It is also key in food production.

The right to sanitation enables people to access a clean and healthy environment, without it there are barriers to other rights, such as health and education.

Water must be available and accessible to all people in sufficient quantity and of adequate quality for all of the reasons it is needed. However, there are many ways in which the rights to water and sanitation are violated.

Pollution can make water unsafe. Water scarcity can lead to devastating drought. The climate crisis can often make this worse, exacerbating the lack of accessible, clean water. Governments and companies might control water supplies in ways which ensure people do not have adequate access to it. Human rights defenders have even been threatened with death for speaking out for this right.",right water vital every living thing without would die need water drink clean cooking sanitation also right water essential enjoyment human right including right life also key food production right sanitation enables people access clean healthy environment without barrier right health education water must available accessible people sufficient quantity adequate quality reason needed however many way right water sanitation violated pollution make water unsafe water scarcity lead devastating drought climate crisis often make worse exacerbating lack accessible clean water government company might control water supply way ensure people adequate access human right defender even threatened death speaking right
"We all have the right to education. Education is vital for human fulfilment and personal development, and it also enables us to access and better enjoy other rights, such as work, adequate housing, and a decent standard of living.

The right to education includes lifelong education at all levels (primary, secondary and tertiary), in either formal or informal settings. Primary level education is compulsory and must be provided for free to everyone. At higher levels governments must work towards making it free as well whilst still ensuring it is available and affordable to all.

Governments must prioritize and budget for free, affordable and quality public education, using and maximizing their resources to fund public schools, which are physically accessible and of adequate quality.

When this doesn’t happen, it can cause great inequality, such as what Amnesty International found when it investigated in South Africa.",right education education vital human fulfilment personal development also enables u access better enjoy right work adequate housing decent standard living right education includes lifelong education level primary secondary tertiary either formal informal setting primary level education compulsory must provided free everyone higher level government must work towards making free well whilst still ensuring available affordable government must prioritize budget free affordable quality public education using maximizing resource fund public school physically accessible adequate quality doesnt happen cause great inequality amnesty international found investigated south africa
"The right to food is more than just the right to eat enough to not die of starvation. Food should be available in sufficient quantities and be of high enough quality to satisfy everyone eating it, both in terms of health and dietary needs and within a given culture. It should also be affordable and accessible in a way that is sustainable.

In reality however, although there is enough food grown, produced and manufactured around the world for no one to go hungry or suffer from malnutrition, millions of people cannot access adequate and nutritious food on a daily basis due to government failings and multiple crises such as conflict and climate.

There are many ways in which the right to food can be affected by inadequate actions by governments. Food insecurity might be caused by huge rises in prices, or crisis situations might cause humanitarian aid (such as food and water supplies) might be blocked, for example in Ethiopia.",right food right eat enough die starvation food available sufficient quantity high enough quality satisfy everyone eating term health dietary need within given culture also affordable accessible way sustainable reality however although enough food grown produced manufactured around world one go hungry suffer malnutrition million people can not access adequate nutritious food daily basis due government failing multiple crisis conflict climate many way right food affected inadequate action government food insecurity might caused huge rise price crisis situation might cause humanitarian aid food water supply might blocked example ethiopia
"The right to health is closely interwoven with all other human rights. We all have the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This includes what we call the “social determinants of health”, such as a healthy environment, freedom from violence and discrimination, food, housing, sanitation, water, and education and social security.

The right to health is not a right to be healthy, but to entitle everyone access to a health system that allows you to maintain and secure your health. Different groups of people – women, children, older persons, and people living with disabilities – might have specific needs, and governments should ensure these are understood and adequately addressed.

Despite this there are still many instances of health inequity, where some people are not able to access healthcare as easily as others. During the Covid-19 pandemic for example, there was widespread vaccine inequality, when the pharmaceutical industry restricted access to lifesaving vaccines from lower-income countries. Health inequity can also be caused by things like medication shortages, when governments have failed to adequately prepare for healthcare needs by not ensuring supplies are available, or by expensive fees which make accessing care and medicines unaffordable.

Governments can also fail to uphold the right to health by mismanaging public health crises, such as was also seen during the pandemic.",right health closely interwoven human right right highest attainable standard physical mental health includes call social determinant health healthy environment freedom violence discrimination food housing sanitation water education social security right health right healthy entitle everyone access health system allows maintain secure health different group people woman child older person people living disability might specific need government ensure understood adequately addressed despite still many instance health inequity people able access healthcare easily others covid19 pandemic example widespread vaccine inequality pharmaceutical industry restricted access lifesaving vaccine lowerincome country health inequity also caused thing like medication shortage government failed adequately prepare healthcare need ensuring supply available expensive fee make accessing care medicine unaffordable government also fail uphold right health mismanaging public health crisis also seen pandemic
"All of us have the right to adequate housing: a safe and secure place to call our home. You should be legally allowed to live there, and your housing should have access to basic services and infrastructure, such as water and sanitation. It must be affordable, and it must be adequate to protect you and your family from bad weather, disease and pollution.

Nobody should be homeless. According to international human rights law and standards, homelessness is an extreme violation of the right to adequate housing (among other rights).

Unfortunately, there are many other ways in which this right is violated, such as people being displaced in conflicts, and via practices such as forced evictions, like those of indigenous people like the Maasai, and by corporations, such as mining companies in the DRC.",u right adequate housing safe secure place call home legally allowed live housing access basic service infrastructure water sanitation must affordable must adequate protect family bad weather disease pollution nobody homeless according international human right law standard homelessness extreme violation right adequate housing among right unfortunately many way right violated people displaced conflict via practice forced eviction like indigenous people like maasai corporation mining company drc
"Everyone has a right to social security. The right to social security is your right to access benefits to help you enjoy an adequate standard of living even when you do not have enough money and are unable to provide for your own basic needs. There are many situations in which you or others might not have enough income to get by without some extra support, including: unemployment, sickness, disability, maternity/paternity, injury, bereavement, and older age.

It is specifically aimed at reducing poverty, and ensuring that everyone can access their right to lead a dignified life, food, health, housing, education, work, and the prevention of social exclusion.

Even in lower-income countries where resources are limited, governments must at very least ensure the existence and operation of a social security system that provides essential support for all who need it.

"We all have the right to work, which includes both the rights to work and a set of rights at work (which are sometimes also called “labour rights”). All workers are protected by these rights whether you work in the formal or informal sector, are a migrant worker, a temporary worker or are self-employed.

Although the right to work is not the right to a job, it is a right to opportunities and conditions that can secure you decent work, enabling an adequate standard of living for you and your family.

Governments should provide support services to help people access work opportunities, and they must also develop ways to increase the number and range of opportunities available. Work opportunities must be available to all people without discrimination. Workers must also be able to form and join unions and engage in collective action.

No one should be forced in any way to work.

However, there is widespread violation of workers’ rights. Millions of people are forced to work against their will, or work in degrading and unfair conditions, such as in some Amazon warehouses. Others, due to lack of opportunity, have little choice but to take jobs in the “gig economy”, often meaning long hours, precarious contracts and unreliable pay.

Migrant workers are often among the worst exploited, and people can be manipulated into doing difficult and dangerous jobs with no protections from unscrupulous employers. This can lead to scenarios of what we call forced labour, which is a form of modern slavery.",right work includes right work set right work sometimes also called labour right worker protected right whether work formal informal sector migrant worker temporary worker selfemployed although right work right job right opportunity condition secure decent work enabling adequate standard living family government provide support service help people access work opportunity must also develop way increase number range opportunity available work opportunity must available people without discrimination worker must also able form join union engage collective action one forced way work however widespread violation worker right million people forced work work degrading unfair condition amazon warehouse others due lack opportunity little choice take job gig economy often meaning long hour precarious contract unreliable pay migrant worker often among worst exploited people manipulated difficult dangerous job protection unscrupulous employer lead scenario call forced labour form modern slavery
